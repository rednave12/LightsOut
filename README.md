# LightsOut
My basic p5.js version of Lights Out: Classic Edition

This was my first ever real miniproject and first foray in to javascript. I was able to trundle my way through by watching The Coding Train's video on Minesweeper - a totally different game but nonetheless on a 2D grid. As yet I don't fully understand some of what I did, namely how/why constructor functions work and why the .prototype is used for some functions and not others. My experience before this was a university C++ module which was more similar to javascript than I expected.
